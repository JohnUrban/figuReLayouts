# figuReLayouts
An R-script with attempts to provide some common layouts for figure making.

This just makes use of layout and works well with base plotting.

There are a lot of other options available, but when I did an extremely short and incomplete survey/attempted to use some, it seemed they needed to be lattice or ggplot2 plots.

That observation may be wrong. Please feel free to tell me in the issues section, and I will update here to redirect any unsuspecting victims.

Having said that, this little set of functions that make use of layout() has helped me generate some nice figures.

Feel free to contribute, and I will add your name to the list of contributors.
